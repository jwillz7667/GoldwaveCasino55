Recommendations for Creating a System Like FireKiren
Based on the analysis of your current codebase, here are several recommendations to enhance and develop a robust system similar to FireKiren. These suggestions cover various aspects, including architecture, security, scalability, and user experience.

1. Architecture and Design
   a. Modular Structure
   Ensure your application follows a modular architecture to enhance maintainability and scalability. This involves separating concerns such as routing, controllers, services, and models.
   Current Observation:
   You have separate controllers like AdminController, AdminGameController, and TransactionController, which is a good start.
   Recommendation:
   Introduce a Service Layer where business logic resides. Controllers should primarily handle HTTP requests and delegate processing to services.
   Example:
   ;
   b. RESTful API Design
   Ensure your API adheres to RESTful principles for consistency and ease of use.
   Current Observation:
   Routes like /api/admin/games, /api/admin/transactions are appropriately structured.
   Recommendation:
   Use proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) corresponding to actions.
   Implement API Versioning to manage changes over time.
   ;
2. Security Enhancements
   a. Authentication and Authorization
   Strengthen your authentication mechanisms and ensure robust authorization controls.
   Current Observation:
   Usage of JWT for authentication and role-based permission checks.
